**Introduction:**
  Team 2 has been tasked with creating a Virtual Reality video presentation for the Colorado River State Historic Park in Yuma, AZ. The video will consist of routing the viewer through the numerous buildings and walkways around the park, giving the viewer a quick glance of the offerings. This video presentation will ultimately be uploaded and hosted on their website. 

**Purpose:**
  The purpose of this video is to entice new visitors to the park. The video will not highlight any of the attractions instead it will tease the overall experience by showing specific areas of the park. We do not want to give anything away with this video so that the viewer will think they have already seen what is to offer. We want the viewer to want to come visit the park, to walk throughout the exhibits and buildings firsthand.

**Scope:**
  Our team has a good knowledge of what our clients want based upon our initial meeting. We can see how this type of video can entice viewers thinking about making the trip to say ‘this looks like a great place, let’s plan a trip’. We have outlined a few requirements that we think will lead to a completed product on time.

**User Needs:**
	The user can interact with the video in the website which can be done in any device and possibly have the option to use a VR headset to interact with the area captured by the MatterPort camera. The user will also require a working internet connection, as well as another device which the VR headset will be plugged into. 


**System Features and Requirements:**

**Functional Requirements:** Specifies what the product or service must do

+ The video shall show the inside & outside of buildings as well as the routes to and from.
+ The video must not show too much so that visitors will still desire to visit the park.
+ Ease of use and a UI that makes sense

**Non-Functional Requirements:** Demonstrate properties that the product or service should have in order to do what must be done.

+ The video should not move too slow/fast.
+ The video shall be in a full 360/virtual reality environment.


**Global Requirements:** Describes the highest level of requirements within the service or product. They can be thought of as general requirements.

+ The user will have the license to use the camera
+ Must procure license (or give info to the park) so that the park can use the finished video
+ Must have access to the website or to contact with the website owner
+ Tie into the current website as seamlessly as possible

**Product/Project Constraints:** Requirements that, on the surface, resemble design constraints or project constraints.

+ Learning curve with using the camera / software
+ Understanding how much video to record to accomplish a tour
+ Identifying what needs to be recorded versus what would be nice to have
