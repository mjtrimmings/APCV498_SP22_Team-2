# APCV498_SP22_Team-2
    This project is a Virtual Reality video presentation for the Colorado River State Historic Park 
    located in Yuma, AZ. The stakeholders of the project are Tammy Snook and Brett Frame. They would
    like this video to be uploaded to their website in order to give potential visitors a quick look at 
    the park and its offerings. 

	The immediate customer would be Tammy and Brett with the end customer being the viewer of the website 
    interested in a trip to visit the park. The stakeholders are looking for us to produce a quality video
    that displays the offerings of the park without giving anything away. They feel that this could help to
    entice new visitors to the park and their attractions. The stakeholder benefit would be the increased 
    visitor count which leads to increased revenue for the park. The website does not currently have a video
    of this type so it would be a new addition to the site. Stakeholders also mentioned that the VR tour should
    not show everything about the park as that might deter potential visitors.

	Our team will be utilizing a state of the art Matterport camera. The Matterport software can be found at 
    https://buy.matterport.com/ and has a few pricing options based on needs. This will likely be difficult for 
    the team as no team member has experience with the camera or software. It is unknown what level of licensing 
    we will need because we do not currently know how many rooms or “Active Spaces” (according to the Matterport 
    licensing page) our team will be capturing.  One member of our team will work with our Professor to gain access 
    to the camera and visit the park in order to collect the relevant footage for the video. 

	The use of a Matterport camera is new to the majority of the team. There are currently no dedicated roles for 
    particular members of the group except for someone who lives in Yuma to be our point of contact in case it is 
    needed. The team‘s primary method of communication is through Microsoft Teams with collaboration on documents using 
    Google Drive and email. So far, our communication with each other and with the client has been satisfactory. 
    Lastly, consideration has to be given to figuring out how we’re going to upload the VR Tour and how it’s going to 
    interact with the current Quartermaster Depot website as we will likely not have access to upload/modify the website 
    and will have to work closely with their current webmaster.

	Completion of the project should be feasible based on our initial meeting with the client. The team will maintain 
    semi regular contact through zoom to keep track of progress on the project and communicate ideas. There are no legal 
    or regulatory constraints that we are aware of at this time and none are expected to show up in the future either. 
    Most of the resources needed for this project will stem from software used to develop the project and camera content 
    from the location all of which should be readily available.
